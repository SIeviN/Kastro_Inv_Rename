# This script is to take a file, list of files, or directory (with files that a specific name) and take
# a customer name from within and prepend it to the filename. This customer name can be found in the XML tag for Customer Acct Number

# It can be compiled to an executable by installing pyinstaller then running the command "pyinstaller --onefile <filename>"
# Alternatively it can just be run as a python script using python3.5+ as it relies on only the python standard library

# python3 cust_invoice_rename.py [file(s) or path]
